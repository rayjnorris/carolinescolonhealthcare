                                    <p>The purpose of the colon as an eliminative organ is to remove waste material by mass muscular contraction called peristalsis.</p>
                                    <p><em><strong>Colon therapy provides therapeutic improvement of muscular tone, facilitates peristalsis and benefits the atonic (sluggish) colon</strong></em>.</p>
                                    <p>The colon is approximately 6 feet long and when constipated, the walls of the colon are generally packed or lined with accumulated feces from extended periods of intestinal overloading due to the avoidance of responding to the “call of nature” immediately. The colon can neither absorb nor eliminate properly in this condition. When wastes from the blood arrive at the inner wall of the colon, that hardened feces prevent their passage through this wall. Since blood circulates through every organ in the body and reaches every cell in the body, toxins in the blood contaminate the entire body. To properly cleanse the body tissue, a thorough cleansing of the bowel is necessary. It took time to pollute the body to the point of disease so it will take time to reverse the process through a series of colon cleansings.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Colon Hydrotherapy (also called Colonics, High Enema, Colon Lavage)</strong> is the safe, gentle infusion of warm filtered water into the rectum using no chemicals or drugs. It is a restorative, painless procedure which is both relaxing and effective. The individual lies comfortably on a custom treatment table and the therapist gently inserts a small speculum into the rectum. The therapist then monitors the temperature and pressure of the water infused into and out of the colon (large intestine) without any assistance on the part of the individual.</p>
                                    <p>This will induce peristaltic contractions in the colon, and the patient will begin to expel fecal matter thru the colonic hose which leads back to the colonic machine and through a clear glass viewing tube. It is quite interesting to see what is expelled during a normal colonic treatment. One may see mucous, parasites and very old feculent material (noted by its dark black color) pass through this tube. This old feculent material may have been lying in the patient’s colon for years. In addition, the patient may experience sensations of warmth due to the presence of toxins in the feculent matter. While the patient is receiving the colonic treatment, the colon therapist lightly massages various parts of the abdomen to help loosen and dislodge areas of fecal impaction.</p>
                                    <p>Colon therapy cleanses the entire colon without stressing the individual and provides a closed system in which waste material is eliminated through the instrument and out the drain line, avoiding any offensive odor and maintaining the dignity of the individual. Colon therapy is an extended and more complete form of an enema. The enema’s cleansing activity is limited to the area of the rectum and to shorter periods of time due to the body’s natural wish to expel any material from the rectum. The colon therapy method extends beyond the rectum to cleanse the entire large intestine and offer greater cleansing and therapeutic benefits. Enemas or laxatives may precipitate dehydration in the individual, but colon hydrotherapy, in effect, would improve the hydration status of the individual.</p>

                                    <p>Colon Hydrotherapy is not a cure, but it is a valuable procedure and treatment for a wide variety of different colon conditions. A toxic bowel is the source of many health problems. By stripping the old toxic mucus lining of the bowel, the number one source of disease in the body is removed. In addition, the bowel is open to a more efficient means of waste elimination and nutrient absorption, both of which are essential to any lasting healing process. This is also the first step toward normalizing the bowel so that the friendly bacteria will flourish to keep the colon safe from putrefaction and further autointoxication.</p>
                                    <p>It is significant that surgeons and physicians are beginning to understand the importance of bowel care in the prevention of disease. General toning of the intestinal muscles and elimination system may have beneficial effects on other body system, especially lymph and blood circulation skin, muscles and joints, and the genitourinary tract, as well as reduced stress on the liver or gallbladder.</p>

                                    <p class="testimony-text">Fifteen years ago we had no idea what&nbsp;‘colon therapy’&nbsp;entailed, but we were becoming increasingly motivated by a goal of&nbsp;‘wellness’.<br>My business life and my wife’s support requires constant stress management to combat energy loss; digestion issues as well as attacks to our immune systems. Colonics have been at the forefront of these battles. We are confident in saying that routine colonics are helping win the war against the physical and emotional ravages of everyday stress and toxic environments.</p>
